# The Basic of Perlin Noise | Roblox Studio

This folder contains everything you need, in order to create what was demonstrated [in the video](https://youtu.be/yA210k9ie8Y). If you want to download the project files to have a look at, for yourself, then just [click on the .rbx file](https://github.com/KiyanEiles/YouTubeVideoFiles/blob/main/The%20Basics%20of%20Perlin%20Noise/PerlinNoiseBasics.rbxl); click download; and then it should be ready for you to open. Once opened, check out the ServerScriptService, to which you will find the main script that was used in the video.

**Enjoy!**
