**The Basic of Perlin Noise | Roblox Studio**

This folder contains everything you need, in order to create what was demonstrated in the video. If you want to download the project files to have a look at, for yourself, then just click on the .rbx file; click download; and then it should be ready for you to open. Once opened, check out the ServerScriptService, to which you will find the main script that was used in the video.

Enjoy!
